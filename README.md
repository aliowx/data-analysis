## Dataset Description

![Dataset Image](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Dataset+Image)

The dataset includes information about:

- **Fuel consumption metrics**
- **Vehicle specifications**
- **Emission levels**

| Column Name      | Description                    |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| `FuelConsumption` | Fuel consumption data (L/100km) |
| `CO2Emissions`   | CO2 emissions (g/km)          |
| `EngineSize`     | Size of the vehicle's engine  |
| `Cylinders`      | Number of engine cylinders    |
